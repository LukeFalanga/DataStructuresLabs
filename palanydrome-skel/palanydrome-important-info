This folder contains the contents of the "palanydrome" lab. The word palanydrome is a play on "palindrome," but instead of being exclusive to numbers and characters, the palanydrome is available to all types. The goal of the lab was to create a function to check if a vector input was a palanydrome, and was accomplished by use of recursion and a parameter of vector<T>, with T being a placeholder for any type.

The code in the following file was written by me:
ispalanydrome.hpp

The code in the following file was given by the professor:
main.cpp
