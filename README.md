# DataStructuresLabs
This repository will contain all code that has been written by me, as well as given skeleton codes, from my Data Structures Course.

Each lab will be placed into the repository as a folder containing each file used in the code, as well as the skeleton code given by the professor. Inside the folder will also be a text file clarifying what the skeleton code is, and what my code is. This will make it easier to understand what I have personally accomplished, as well as how my solution plays a part in the program as a whole.
